# Android voice control app for LegoÂ® Mindstorms EV3.
The voice interaction scenarios were built with [Api.ai](api.ai).

## Getting started
1. Register with [Api.ai](http://api.ai)
2. Create an agent
3. Import agent from the zip file **agent/apiai_lego_agent.zip**. Import can be done from the agent's settings page.
4. Use agent's API keys in the app an build the APK

## Using the app
0. Pre-requisite: EV3 needs to be running LejOS - see instructions [here](http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Installing%20leJOS/)
1. Start the app
2. Open application settings (top right corner)
3. Specify keys from the agent and EV3's IP address
4. Say a voice command, e.g. "Move 1 step forward"
